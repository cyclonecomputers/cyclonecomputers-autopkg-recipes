# ConnectWise ScreenConnect
This folder contains generic recipes for ConnectWise [ScreenConnect](https://www.screenconnect.com) (formerly ConnectWise Control) along with a custom URL generator processor.

## Usage
You can use the input variables to specify the specific Company (`COMPANY_NAME`), Site (`SITE_NAME`), and/or Department (`DEPARTMENT_NAME`) which will be used to build the installer. These values get substituted into the server specific download URL. Any/all of these three values can be left blank if they are not used.

The `SERVER_URL` input variable must be supplied in an override because it will be specific to a given ScreenConnect installation. The server url should include the protocol (http or https) as well as any port numbers if required.

The URL which is generated by the processor will be a form similar to the below (name values will be url encoded):  
> `SERVER_URL`/Bin/ScreenConnect.ClientSetup.pkg?e=Access&y=Guest&c=`COMPANY_NAME`&c=`SITE_NAME`&c=`DEPARTMENT_NAME`&c=&c=&c=&c=&c=

E.g.  
> https<area>://control.example.com:8443/Bin/ScreenConnect.ClientSetup.pkg?e=Access&y=Guest&c=Test%20Company&c=Test%20Site&c=Test%20Department&c=&c=&c=&c=&c=
